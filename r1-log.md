# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Simon Lowes

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [21st October, Saturday, 2023].

## Log

### R1D1

1: Coming back to this challenge after stopping

2: I can already code but not proficient enough

3: I will not use ChatGPT or any AI to aid me

4: AI is a great teacher but can be prone to "spitting" code out

5: This leads to confusion later if I can't grasp the code

6: This is in the face of usually being able to grasp it but not always!

7: Which is due to previous study

8: The only coding I did: editing my webite by removing defective code

9: I updated Homebrew and Git

10: I forked/cloned this repo

11: Read more of the Odin Project lessons

12: Established basic rules for this challenge

### R1D2

1: Unexpectedly wasn't able to return home

2: This meant plan B - learn basic Python commands from docs

3: I used https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ to practice

4: Will take my machine EVERYWHERE from now on

5: Did some reading on Odin Project

6: One hour of fumbling but at least something

### R1D3

1: More life stuff got in the way

2: Went through Traversy Media Modern JS course

### R1D4

1: More Modern JS

2: Slow. Life causing brain fog. May need to go back over.

### R1D5

1: Continued Modern JS, much better brain today

### R1D6

1: Modern JS, slowly

2: Planning on using local library for longer sesssion tomorrow

### R1D7

1: Modern JS continues

2: Life stress is high meaning focus is low

3: Will go over the same things until they stick

4: I need to facilitate flow as best as I can

### R1D8

1: I missed a day due to stress which is ok rules wise

2: Modern JS, I grasp it but it will take a while to be memorised

3: The loss of my reading glasses is taking a toll

4: I'm progressing at least

### R1D9

1: Modern JS

### R1D10

1: Continuing with Modern JS

2: Brain starting to feel ok about not retaining all extra information

3: Crucially, I understand so far

4: I will run into parts I'll need to research for lack of undersanding

5: Much better today!

### R1D11

1: Modern JS will continue for a lot of days

2: Got to a part with an actual test/challenge will go back next time

3: Have to try do this earlier in the day

4: Kinda worried because AI will code everything with an LLM soon

5: Even so, learning is rewarding in the end. Frustrating but rewarding

1: Challenges aka no hand holding are tough

2: I looked over a previous lesson for hints

3: I did actually reach my own, unorthodox solution

4: I'm not too discouraged, I've been very tired/stressed

5: Must must do this earlier in the day

### R1D13

1: Forgot to upload/update!

2: Still modern JS, moving on to Python for a change soon

3: Also got a project with React Native/Python/Raspberry Pi coming

### R1D14

1: Looked at React basics JS and Native. For Pi Project will be good

2: Challenges in JS course are frustrating, memory not good

3: Will need to go over lessons from beginning several times to cement

4: Apparently this is normal

5: Earlier I used Khan Academy for basic JS, good resource

6: My brain will take time to feel comfortable/gain strength

7: I need to remember that I don't always understand conventional methods of tuition and not be so hard on myself

### R1D15

1: Went over Modern JS lessons so far. Don't feel as if I can advance without being able to nail the basics

2: Passed out with my laptop, didn't update/push to GitHub

### R1D16

1: Going over lessons already covered again. This is pit of despair stuff

2: I've questioned if it's the course/tutor but he's got a great reputation so I feel really dumb

3: My life won't be my own very soon, this is very depressing

4: GREAT

### R1D17

1: Used coding apps today to have a break from JS

2: Sololearn, Mimo and Brilliant - all useful/fun

3: I'm not afraid of algebra anymore but I don't like it

4: Variables/loops all covered today

5: Refreshing way to learn/cover old ground

### R1D18

1: Used coding apps again

2: Brilliant is helping me discover maths and not be afraid

3: Lapses in concentration due to stress

4: Still feels like snails pace

### R1D19

1: Daily coding apps

2: Daily Brilliant helping my understanding of code

3: Went back over Modern JS course

4: Life stress really getting in the way of focus

### R1D20

1: Using daily code apps aside from main course

2: Interleaving learning keeps from becomming boring

3: Went over challenge I had solved in non-standard way and reinforced several ways of solving the same problem

4: Am using GitHub CoPilot Chat to merely explain code as an extra teacher/coach. Technically uses GPT but is helping me learn which is top priority

### R1D21

1: Back to modern JS

2: Getting used to basic concepts

3: I need to go over things at least twice before things start to stick

### R1D22

1: Spent a few hours trying to make two GTPs

2: Not confident enough to use actions in order to make API calls. Will find a simple course on using APIs and experiment

3: Started 100 Days of Python (Udemy Course) which has been frustrating yet rewarding when solving the problems.

4: Learning JS and Python helps cement common programming skills and prevents boredom

5: Today I wanted to do it all, but I did focus on Python in the end

6: My eye is recovering already, scary for a while.

7: Day 22 done!

### R1D23

1: More Python

2: Brain definitely not working today
